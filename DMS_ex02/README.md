This reportory was created with the purpose to complete de ex_2 of DMS. In this reportory the question asked in the exercise is answered.

Answer to question in ex:

The column `primary_key` is not valid as primary key anymore - can you explain why? You can delete it.

Because I transposed the data of each year for the same Region, leaving the primary_key repeated 4 times for each year. We used this to organize the data, but know it lost its purpose.
